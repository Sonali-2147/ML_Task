# Image Classification Task: Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset used for this task is the MNIST dataset, which is widely used in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition.

## Dataset: MNIST
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels. It is split into two subsets:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images

Each image is labeled with a digit from 0 to 9, corresponding to the digit depicted in the image.

### Downloading the Dataset
The MNIST dataset can be accessed via popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn. Alternatively, it can be downloaded directly from [Yann LeCun's MNIST page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Objective
The goal of this task is to train a model that accurately classifies handwritten digit images into their respective categories (0-9). The performance of the model will be evaluated using accuracy metrics on the test set.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
   - Reshape images if required by the chosen model architecture.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose an appropriate model architecture, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a simple dense neural network.
   - Use TensorFlow/Keras as the implementation framework.

3. **Training**:
   - Split the training set further into training and validation subsets.
   - Train the model using the training subset.
   - Monitor performance on the validation subset to avoid overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the test set using accuracy as the primary metric.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Experiment with different architectures, learning rates, and regularization techniques to improve performance.
